# The Rust line-coverage floor, in three steps over cargo-llvm-cov's one profile directory:
#
#   rust-coverage.sh --clear     empty it, once, before the crates run
#   rust-coverage.sh <crate>     that crate's tests, instrumented, profiles kept
#   rust-coverage.sh --report    one report over every crate's run, held to 95% lines
#
# The crates holding or spawning production code (the deliverable and its e2e journeys)
# run their Nx `test` target through this script, after the clear (workspace:coverage-clear);
# `just test` reports once over every run, so the binary the journeys spawn counts. The
# test-only crates that exercise scripts measure no Rust and run uninstrumented. Quiet on
# success; on failure the reason and what to do.
